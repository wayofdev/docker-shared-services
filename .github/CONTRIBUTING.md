## 💻 Workflow

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Please feature/fix/update... into individual PRs (not one changing everything)

- **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
- **Create a Branch**: In your fork, create a new branch for your work. Name it appropriately based on the feature, fix, or update you're working on.
- **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes
- **Run Tests**: Ensure all tests pass and the code adheres to the coding standards.
- **Update Documentation**: If you've made changes that affect the project's documentation, ensure it is updated.
- **Run Linters**: Ensure your code passes all linting checks using `make lint`.
- **Commit Your Changes**: Use the [Conventional Commits](#-commit-message-guidelines) standard for your commit messages. You can use `make commit` to assist in creating commit messages.
- **Push Your Changes**: Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
- **Open a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to the `master` branch of the original repository. Ensure your PR is focused, addressing a single feature, fix, or improvement.

- [`workflows/auto-merge-release.yml`](workflows/auto-merge-release.yml)
- [`workflows/coding-standards.yml`](workflows/coding-standards.yml)
- [`workflows/create-release.yml`](workflows/create-release.yml)
- [`workflows/e2e-macos.yml`](workflows/e2e-macos.yml) — **Currently disabled**
- [`workflows/e2e-ubuntu.yml`](workflows/e2e-ubuntu.yml) — **Currently disabled**
- [`workflows/shellcheck.yml`](workflows/shellcheck.yml)

## 📝 Before You Contribute

- **Tests**: Include tests that cover any new features or bug fixes, if applicable.
- **Code Quality**: Utilize `make lint` for code style checks.
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation to reflect your changes, ensuring other developers can understand and use your contributions effectively.
- **Commits**: use Conventional Commits standard to create a commit

git commit -am 'fix: something has been fixed'
```

**Allowed Prefixes:**

## 🔍 Coding Standards and Tools

We enforce coding standards to maintain high code quality and readability. Here's a list of tools we use:

### → Yaml Lint

We use [`yamllint`](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) to enforce coding standards in YAML files.

To lint yaml files run:

```bash
make lint-yaml
```

by default, [`cytopia/yamllint`](https://github.com/cytopia/docker-yamllint) Docker image will be used to run linter.

### → Action Lint

We use [`actionlint`](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) to enforce coding standards in GitHub Actions workflows.

To lint GitHub Actions run:

```bash
make lint-actions
```

### → Markdown Lint

We use [`markdownlint-cli2`](https://github.com/davidanson/markdownlint-cli2) to enforce coding standards in Markdown files.

To lint markdown files run:

```bash
make lint-md-dry
make lint-md
```

<br>

## 🧪 Tests

We use [`dgoss`](https://github.com/goss-org/goss/blob/master/extras/dgoss/README.md) and [`dcgoss`](https://github.com/goss-org/goss/blob/master/extras/dcgoss/README.md) to test Docker images and `docker-compose` files.

Run

```sh
make tests
```

to run all the tests.

## 📦 Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are an optional but highly recommended way to automate the linting and quality checks before committing changes to the repository. This project provides a predefined configuration that helps in maintaining code quality and consistency.

### → Configured Hooks

Our pre-commit configuration includes several hooks:

- **Trailing Whitespace**: Removes unnecessary trailing spaces.
- **End-of-File Fixer**: Ensures that files end with a newline.
- **Check Added Large Files**: Prevents accidentally adding large files to the git repository, with a current limit set to 600 KB.
- **Commitizen**: Ensures commit messages meet the conventional commit format. This hook is triggered at the commit message stage.

### → Installing Pre-commit Hooks

To utilize these hooks, you first need to install them using the command provided by the Makefile:

```bash
make hooks
```
